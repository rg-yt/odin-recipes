        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <hr>
        <ul>
            <li>3 (5 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, or to taste, divided</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon blackened seasoning, or to taste</li>
            <li>3 cups mini farfalle pasta</li>
            <li>¾ cup fresh asparagus tips</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped sun-dried tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 cup baby spinach leaves</li>
            <li>¼ cup butter</li>
            <li>8 ounces heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon white cooking wine</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups shredded Parmesan cheese, or more to taste</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <hr>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. At the same time, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.</li>
            <li>Coat chicken with 1 tablespoon oil and season with blackened seasoning.</li>
            <li>Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 10 to 12 minutes, flipping halfway through. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
            <li>At the same time, add farfalle to the boiling water. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes.</li>
            <li>While the farfalle is cooking, heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add asparagus tips and sun-dried tomatoes; saute until asparagus is tender, about 5 minutes. Add spinach and cover until wilted, about 1 minute. Stir to combine and transfer to a bowl. Wipe the skillet clean.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in the same skillet over medium heat. Add cream and cooking wine and cook, whisking constantly, for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and add 1 1/2 cups Parmesan cheese and garlic; stir until cheese is melted. Add asparagus mixture to the sauce and stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Drain pasta, place in a serving bowl, and pour sauce over top. Slice chicken and place on top of pasta. Sprinkle additional Parmesan on top.</li>
        </ol>
